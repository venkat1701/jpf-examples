# Java PathFinder Examples

This repository contains a list of real life scenarios where you can use jpf to detect concurrency problems that can be analyzed by JPF.
JPF is an extensible software used majorly for model checking for the Java bytecode programs. It was developed at the NASA Ames Research Center, open sourced in 2005 and now is freely available on this server under the Apache-2.0 license.
<br>
This repository talks of examples like a distributed cache and message processors and encorporates the use of Java PathFinder to detect potential race conditions, concurrency issues, etc.

## Introduction

JPF initially started as a model checker, but nowadays, it's a runtime system with many different execution modes and extends which go beyond model checking.
<br>
It can be used for detecting and explaining defects, collecting deep runtime information like coverage metric, deducing interesting test vectors and creating corresponding test drivers and many more.

This repository thereby targets to demonstrate the use of JPF in real life scenarios. Java PathFinder(JPF) is known for its capabilities in analyzing Java programs through mdoel checking and detecting 
concurrency issues. Various types of concurrency are covered, and their detection method are demonstrated in this repository. Reference to the official JPF repository and wiki has been provided for further details.
This repository has been designed for researchers, software developers and students interested in learning about concurrency issues and formal verification. A structured approach has been adopted to help users understand JPF's functionality through practical examples.
